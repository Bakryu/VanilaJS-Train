            A study using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to compare humans and
            dogs showed that dogs have the same response to voices and use the
            same parts of the brain as humans do. This gives dogs the ability to
            recognize human emotional sounds, making them friendly social pets
            to humans.

            A 2018 study on canine cognitive abilities found that dogs'
            capabilities are no more exceptional than those of other animals,
            such as horses, chimpanzees, or cats.

            Dogs suffer from the same common disorders as humans; these include
            cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and neurologic disorders. The
            pathology is similar to humans, as is their response to treatment
            and their outcomes. Researchers are now identifying the genes
            associated with dog diseases similar to human disorders but lack
            mouse models to find cures for dogs and humans. The genes involved
            in canine obsessive-compulsive disorders led to the detection of
            four genes in humans' related pathways.
